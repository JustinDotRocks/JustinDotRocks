# Hi there, I'm Justin Smith! 👋

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me
I'm a web developer enrolled in the **GetBuilding** program, transitioning from being self-taught to becoming a skillfully crafted professional. I'm passionate about building technology that creates impactful solutions in the non-profit sector and bridges connections between technology, nature, and people.

## 🌱 Currently Working On
- **📅 MarkIT**: An event space management tool built with React, TypeScript, and Node.js. Currently developing the backend to enhance functionality, data management, and scalability.

- **🦋 Enhancement of SpeciesFinder**: Collaborating with a **group** of developers to refactor and redesign **SpeciesFinder**  for Manuels River using React, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript. The project will relaunch in multiple phases:
  - **Phase 1** 🛠️: Relaunch with a redesigned front end.
  - **Phase 2** 🔐: Integrate a backend and database with login capabilities.
  - **Phase 3** 🌎: Expand to a citizen science project, allowing users to submit findings to be included in the app.
  - **Phase 4** 🌲: Grow from a single-organization tool to a regional platform that supports multiple trails, nature centers, and sites.
 
- **🌊 Manuels River Interactive Tour**: Developing an interactive tour application for Manuels River, featuring points of interest along the river trail. The app will include:
  - A rustic map for exploring and discovering unique sites, stories, natural wonders, and the beauty of nature along the riverside of Manuels River.
  - Interactive icons marking primary and secondary points of interest.
  - Pop-up modals with images, audio, and descriptions for each primary POI.
  - Full map view, an about section, and adventures along both Canyon Trail and Ocean Trail along Manuels River.
